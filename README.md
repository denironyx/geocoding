# Geocoding
Geocoding, a subset of Geographic Information System(GIS) spatial analysis implemented through geocoding software, is composed of a reference dataset and the geocoding algorithm, each of which is composed of sub-operations and sub-components that work together to transform physical, input data into numerical, spatial data.

Alternatively, Geocoding is the process of determining geographic coordinates from place names, street addresses, and codes (e.g, Zip codes). Geocoding is typically preceded by the data cleaning step of preprocessing and standardizing the format of the data you will be geocoding. Related tasks include:

-   Batch geocoding: Geocoding multiple addresses, place names or codes at one time.
-   Reverse geocoding: This is the process by which geographic coordinates are converted into a physical address. Determining the nearest street address for a given point location specified as a latitude and longitude. 
- Pattern Matching: location based resolutions
